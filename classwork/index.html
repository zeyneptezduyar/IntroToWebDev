        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p>
            I am 20 years old and I study Computer Science in The University of Manchester.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day I would like to become a grahical developer for a game company where I can pursue my dream of combining art and programmin.

        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
        <p>
            My favourite hobby is to play the piano and sing. With music I can truly be myself and demonstrate my feeling to an audience with art.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love to swim. I wsa a professional and licenced swimmer for more than 8 years. I had to quit my team when I moved to The UK. However, I still train by myself whenever I have time.
